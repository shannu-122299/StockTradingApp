## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shannu-122299/StockTradingApp.git
cd StockTradingApp
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Inside the `server` folder, create a `.env` file:

```env
MONGO_URI=Your_MongoDB_Connection_String
JWT_SECRET=Your_JWT_Secret
PORT=5000
```

A sample `.env.example` file is included in the repository.

### 🔐 Environment Variable Security

The actual `.env` file is not included in this repository because it may contain sensitive information such as the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret.

For security reasons, the `.env` file is excluded from Git tracking using `.gitignore`.

A `.env.example` file is provided as a template. After cloning the repository, create your own `.env` file inside the `server` folder and configure the required values.

> Never commit actual database credentials, JWT secrets, or other sensitive information to a public GitHub repository.

### 4. Start the Backend

```bash
npm start
```

The backend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

### 5. Install and Start the Frontend

Open another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

> Both the backend and frontend servers must be running for the application to work correctly.

- Stock Operations
- Buy & Sell Operations
- Portfolio Management
- Orders
- Wallet Transactions
- Admin Operations

5. Start the backend server.
6. Start the frontend development server.
7. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

Both the **backend server** and **frontend development server** must be running simultaneously for the complete application to work correctly.
